# The flag submission system lets us see the strings you submitted even when they're wrong. Since some of you may consider that a privacy issue,
we decided to demo a flag validation system that checks it client-side before sending the flag to us for checking. Why don't you give it a try

### [Solution]
    Upon connecting to the page if you inspect element the flag is listed in plaintext under Page Content
    Flag:ACI{hidden_in_plain_site)72ae3029}
