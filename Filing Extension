Filing Extension
10 Points
We went to apply for a tax-filing extension with the IRS, and they replied with this image saying it contained the code we needed.
Unfortunately, our computer refuses to display it and just says that it isn't a PNG

Upon examining the file contents using hexedit, I noticed that the proper file extension was present in ascii text, then I renamed the file
to flag.txtst which contained flag.txt in it to get the proper flag

Flag:ACI{g3tt!ng_m0r3_R4nd0M_01f59389}
