We found an old floppy-drive laying around and think that there may be a flag hidden on it somewhere. We managed to copy the drive image,
but there doesn't appear to be any kind of filesystem on it. In fact, all of the data appears to be on the first sector of the disk.

After downloading the image i ran it against qemu and the flag was present for the user to see 
qemu-system-i386 floppy.img
Flag:ACI{BoOt_MaGiC}
